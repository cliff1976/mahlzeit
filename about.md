## the Name ## 
*Mahlzeit!* is a German way to greet someone around lunchtime.

## the Eaters ##

+ [Cliff](https://www.regensblog.com)
+ [Sarah](https://www.reciperoundupproject.com)
+ our local pals
+ our guests from out of town
+ our work peeps

## the Sponsors ##
There are none.  We're not in anyone's pocket.  Peruse here for free knowing that these are honest opinions from people who just want to eat at a restaurant.  You don't have to sell your soul to Big Cookie for a recommendation on the latest *Pommesbude.*

If we ate somewhere and think it would be good to keep in our collective back pocket for 

+ a project team dinner, 
+ a break from the usual lunch routine, or 
+ a four-eyes knock-some-beers-back gripe session, 

it will show up here.  If it sucked, it won't.
