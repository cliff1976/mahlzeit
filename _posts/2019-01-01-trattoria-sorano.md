## Cuisine ##
Italian

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
The Aetna pizza was pleasantly spicy in its pepperoni (sausage).  Our big work dinner guests got round after round of focaccia (expected perk of being a big party, I guess).  On both visits the kitchen sent a very welcome little greeting in the form of some [*arancini*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arancini).

The shisha bar "Dubai" used to be here.  Let's call it "Altstadt-adjacent."  It's really close to the Altstadt.  It's got an Altstadt postal code.  Haven't tried them for lunch yet, but a walk-in table for two and a 10-top work dinner both were pleasant experiences (if a little crowded).
