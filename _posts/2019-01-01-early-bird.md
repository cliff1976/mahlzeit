## Hours ## 
Go early -- "late lunch" as as late as they go.

## Recommendations / Highlights ## 
Their sandwiches -- after 13:00 are a treat.  Try the Early Bird Sandwich:  bacon, an egg, and herbed cream cheese on homemade bread.

## Reservations? ##
Not sure they take 'em, to be honest.  Frequently the larger long-bench tables end up shared between unrelated parties because they don't have enough space for all the 2- or 3-top tables they really need.

## Parking ##
Try Am Protzenweiher, or Dultplatz if necessary and the season permits it.
