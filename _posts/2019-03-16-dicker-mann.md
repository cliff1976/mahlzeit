## Cuisine ##
New International and traditional Bavarian

## Recommendations / Highlights ##

+ Get the *Kaiserschmarrn* for dessert, but be prepared to judge all other *Kaiserschmarren* against it.
+ Bonus:  they have Kuchlbauer beer products and serve the Alte Liebe in a proper Alte Liebe glass.
+ Monday and Tuesday evenings there is a Schnitzel ("Wiener Art," meaning pork, not veal) dinner special.

## Hours ##

Daily from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.<br/>
Serving hot food until 23:00

## Reservations? ##
You better reserve; it's always in high demand.  But surprisingly on a recent Saturday night around 9:00 they were able to accommodate a spontaneous reservation request and pop a *Kaiserschmarrn* in the oven for us while awaiting our arrival.  That worked out great.

## Parking ##
If you have to drive, Arnulfsplatz is probably the closest.  It's pretty much in the middle of the pedestrian zone though.  Best to sleep somewhere within stumbling distance.
