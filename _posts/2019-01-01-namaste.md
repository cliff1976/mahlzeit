## Cuisine ##
Indian

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
Their meaty stuff is just fine, but honestly I pretty much go vegetarian when we're there anymore:  palak paneer, paneer jalfrezi, dal makhni, and channa masala are the go-to dishes.

There is a lunch buffet, which makes an appearance on some weeknights, but that is spiced for the lowest common denominator, so we almost always go Ã  la carte.

## Hours ##
Put the times here.

## Reservations? ##
A must for parties over 4 in number.  You might get a big round table in a little pagoda in the back, which is nice.
