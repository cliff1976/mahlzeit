## Cuisine ##
New international

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
Never had anything there we didn't love.

## Hours ##
They open every day except Saturdays at 11.  They close in the early evening (Fridays at 15:00), so this is not a dinnery place.

## Reservations? ##
Not sure if they take them.  It's on our way on foot into town from home, so we can stop in and see if we need to keep looking or not.

## Address ##
Gabelsbergerstr. 14<br/>
93047 Regensburg

0941 / 38 18 00 79
