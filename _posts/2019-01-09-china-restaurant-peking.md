## Cuisine ##
Chinese

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
Green beans with garlic and dried chilies were.  The won-ton soup, however was a life-changer.

## Hours ##
Closed Mondays.  All the rest of the days open 11:30–15:00 and 17:30–22:30.

## Reservations? ##
Probably a good idea.  The joint was filled up with Asian people(!) on our first visit.  We barely got a table for two.

## Address ##
Sternbergstraße 13<br/>
93047 Regensburg

## Parking ##
There are only a couple spots nearby on premises, so try to walk there if you can.
