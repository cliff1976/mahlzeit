The coffee is really good, and they roast it there.  The cakes were kinda hit-or-miss.

## Cuisine ##
Kaffee und Kuchen, natch, but also great soups and light lunch fare.

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
Had some brown butter sage pumpkin panzerotti there once for lunch that blew my mind.

## Hours ##
Mornings and afternoons, but they close at 19:00 or even 18:00 on some days.

## Reservations? ##
Dunno.  There is some limited seating outside and kind of around the corner, which catches at least a little sunlight on those cold winter weekend mornings where Germans will bundle up under blankets just to be outside.

## Address ##
Am Brixener Hof 6
93047 Regensburg

## Parking ##
Ostensibly there's parking right in front of the joint, but really the Parkhaus Dachauplatz is more likely and nearly as convenient.
