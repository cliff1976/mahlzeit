## Cuisine ##
Greek

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
The vegetarian stuff was uniformly great:

+ spinach and rice and cheese 
+ stuffed grapeleaves
+ grilled artichokes
+ grilled feta
+ grilled peperoni (spicier than we expected, and pleasantly so)

## Hours ##
Dinners only, 17:00 to 22:30, Tuesday through Saturday 

## Reservations? ##
You'll want them for any party bigger than two.  Maybe even also for just two.
