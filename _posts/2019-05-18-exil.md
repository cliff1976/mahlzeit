excerpt: "So glad to see its triumphant return!"

We used to love this place.  All the waiters knew us and would get our drinks ready when they saw us.  We were so sad when they changed ownership and replaced the wonderful, flavorful food with boring stuff about 10 years ago.  Today is their third day of re-opening.  We got old stand-by dishes and were not disappointed.

# What We Ate
Sercan in the foreground and Kurdos Jogurt Kebab in the background.  KJK was chicken döner meat, as opposed to the grilled lamb chunks we knew from the past.
