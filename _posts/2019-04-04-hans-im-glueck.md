## Cuisine ##
Burgers and Fries

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
The meat burgers are fine -- on the fancier side.  But the real treats here are the veggie burgers and the Pfund (500 g) portions of french fries &mdash; thick cut, with one dipping sauce included in the portion.

## Hours ##
Su – Thu 11:30 – 23:00, Fr – Sa 11:30 – 24:00<br/>
Kitchen: Mo – So 11:30 – 23 Uhr 

## Reservations? ##
Yes, make them if you can.  The place is crowded.  Probably don't bother for a party bigger than 2 without a reservation, and you probably also don't want a party bigger than two anyways, given how cramped it can be.  Outdoor seating, if available, is highly desirable, but also difficult for parties larger than two.  Their tables mostly seem to be set up for couples.  You may have to hover for a while and watch for guests to leave to snag an outdoor table.
