## Cuisine ##
Breakfasts and tortes and whatnot. 

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
They (apparently) serve [Zicaffè](https://www.zicaffe.com/en/) brand coffee, which we know and love from [Il Mercato](https://ilmercato-italiano.de/).  The chocolate cake was soft and moist and very, very pretty -- however, it didn't taste as chocolatey as it looked.  Impressive texture though!  They had at least three kinds of cheesecake on offer as well:  

1. apricot
2. mandarin orange
3. blueberry

I shall endeavor to try them all.

Sarah had a surprisingly tasty and cheap and generous Quiche Lorraine.
