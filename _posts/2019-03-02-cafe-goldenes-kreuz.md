Good cakes, tarts and tortes, but you'll probably need another coffee somewhere else afterwards.  Also, it sure seems like an Ü-65 club in there.  Which might explain why the coffee is so weak.

Dogs are welcome.

Kaffee, Kuchen, light breakfasty stuff.

The Don Juan Torte (locally relevant to the city's HRE past) was a nice mix of mild chocolate cake with a cherry ribbon running through it and candied nut topping.

## Parking ##
Crapshoot.  You're nominally closer to Arnulfsplatz and Bismarckplatz, but not meaningfully so compared to Parkhaus Petersweg or Dachauplatz.
