Good cakes, tarts and tortes, but you'll probably need another coffee somewhere else afterwards.  Also, it sure seems like an Ü-65 club in there.  Which might explain why the coffee is so weak.


## Cuisine ##
Kaffee, Kuchen, light breakfasty stuff.

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
The Don Juan Torte (locally relevant to the city's HRE past) was a nice mix of mild chocolate cake with a cherry ribbon running through it and candied nut topping.

## Hours ##
Daily, 7 to midnight.

## Reservations? ##
Tables are reservable.  It can be kind of crowded in there.  Go in, check the table reservation card, sit down and get served.  Just be a good citizen and amscray before the time on the reservation card.

## Address ##
Haidplatz 7 <br/>
93047 Regensburg

+49 941 55812<br/>
The hotel website is [http://www.hotel-goldeneskreuz.de/](http://www.hotel-goldeneskreuz.de/), but it requires Flash.  Don't bother.

## Parking ##
Crapshoot.  You're nominally closer to Arnulfsplatz and Bismarckplatz, but not meaningfully so compared to Parkhaus Petersweg or Dachauplatz.
