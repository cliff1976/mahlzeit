## Cuisine ##
Turkish

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
Get a döner dürüm and ask for extra *Schafskäse* (sheep's cheese) to be put on it.  It's an extra 0,50€ but it's worth so much more.

## Hours ##
They open every day at 10:00.

## Reservations? ##
Doubt it.

## Address ##
Langer Weg 2<br/>
93055 Burgweinting
