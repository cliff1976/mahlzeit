excerpt: We'll vouch for the mantı.
---

## Cuisine ##
Turkish, Italian

## Recommendations / Highlights ##
They do [mantı](https://omg-dumplings.netlify.com/been-there/future-nomst/manti.html).  That's kind of all we ever get there.  They have a whole host of other stuff on offer, and it's probably fine, but all we ever get there are the mantı.  As opposed to [Lezizel](), these are bigger, softer, heavier dumplings.   

## Hours ##
Most notably, they're not open for lunch during the week, except on Fridays.  Check [their site](http://www.madans.de) for exceptions.

## Reservations? ##
Never seen it busy enough to need 'em, but they are next door to some kind of sporting complex, so maybe it does fill up.
