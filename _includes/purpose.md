<p>OK, seriously, it was mostly because I got a bunch of visitors from out of town.  Some of them are picky eaters.  Some of them have dietary restrictions.  Some have been to Regensburg a lot.  Some are noobs.  I wanted to have an easy reference list available.</p>

<p>It's also at least partially for me.  I plan on working from home more than ever before in 2019 and beyond, but maybe that doesn't mean I have to give up lunchtime social interactions completely.  Making this list has shown me there are more options nearby than I thought.</p>

<p>We're trying to keep it lean here.  It's all just text on purpose.</p>
